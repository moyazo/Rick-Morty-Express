# Rick-Morty-Express

Hi there 👋
This App will be dedicated to a normal crud, in order to develop my skills.
Also, you see how i work and you can advise how to program.

### FIRST OF ALL

Before you can work on this repo, you must clone the repo at your local pc.

          $ git clone https://github.com/usuario/repo.git
          $ cd repo


## DEPENDENCIES

Afte you have cloned it, we have to install or dependencies, without them or app will crush.

          - With npm:

              $ npm i

          - With yarn

              $ yarn


## Finally

You can now run up the app. But you should check that de FrontEnd is active or any type of App that allows you to make https petitions.

                - With FrontEnd

                $ Check <a href="https://github.com/moyazo/Rick-Morty-React/tree/main">FrontEnd</a>
                $ yarn start


                - Without FrontEnd

                  Check <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a>


HAPPY HACKING 😎💻
