# Rick-Morty-Express


Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This App will be dedicated to a normal crud, in order to develop my skills.
Also, you see how i work and you can advise how to program.

### FIRST OF ALL
Before you can work on this repo, you must clone the repo at your local pc.

          $ git clone https://github.com/usuario/repo.git
          $ cd repo
          
## DEPENDENCIES
Afte you have cloned it, we have to install or dependencies, without them or app will crush.

          - With npm:
          
              $ npm i
              
          - With yarn
          
              $ yarn
              
## Finally
You can now run up the app. But you should check that de FrontEnd is active or any type of App that allows you to make https petitions.
                
                - With FrontEnd

                $ Check <a href="https://github.com/moyazo/Rick-Morty-React/tree/main">FrontEnd</a>
                $ yarn start
                
                
                - Without FrontEnd
                
                  Check <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a>
                


 HAPPY HACKING ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’»
